# Reflect | Web Library.

## What is this?

Reflect is a small library that speeds up and simplifies the work of JS with HTML and CSS. Unlike similar libraries (jQuery for example), the library has some advantages and features.

```js
const _ = Reflect;

_('#submit-my-form').on('click' (event) => {
  fetch('/reg', { /* */ });
  
  _.refresh();
});
```

## How it use?

Download `index.js` from this repo and add it to your project. Next - read the [Documentation](https://github.com/HarrisonManxe/Reflect/blob/main/sources/documentation.md)

## Good work!
